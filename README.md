# WaterPotability
This is a project for Machine Learning course
Tool used: Python, IDE: JupyterNotebook
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability
Preprocessing:
The dataset has outliers and missing values. We have used MICE Imputation to fill in missing values. Multivariate outliers are removed with Minimum Covariance Determinants
Models:
For learning four models are built: Regression, Classification and clustering.
Results:
Accuracy for SVC is 66.19%, for decision tree is 62.32%, KNN has 63.5%, Random forest classifier has 63.6% and MLP classifier has 66.8%. So, in terms of accuracy MLP Classifier has the highest accuracy among other classifiers.
